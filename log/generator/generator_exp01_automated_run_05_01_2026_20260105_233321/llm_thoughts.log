**Addressing Scheduling Constraints**

I'm currently focused on the scheduling constraints. I've successfully identified the core hard constraint: courses within the same curriculum semester cannot share the same `time_slot`. Now, I'm working to formulate this constraint algorithmically, ensuring that during the course assignment process, this fundamental rule is always upheld. This is essential for preventing scheduling conflicts.

**Formulating the Core Conflict**

I'm now diving deeper into how to handle course conflicts. Initially, I thought that I could treat the input courses as entirely independent. However, upon further reflection, the format of `course_id` suggests there might be semantic connections. If two courses share the same initial part of their `course_id` (e.g., "502045"), this could mean they belong to the same curriculum. Without curriculum data, I'll tentatively handle this by assuming they *cannot* share the same `time_slot`. I am now implementing a check that will compare and account for any potential conflict.

**Prioritizing Conflict Resolution**

I've been thinking about the core challenge: "Courses in the same curriculum semester cannot share the same `time_slot`." Since I lack the `curriculum.json`, I'm cautiously assuming that any courses with similar `course_id` prefixes (e.g., "502045") are potentially from the same semester, thus preventing them from sharing time slots within this batch. This ensures I err on the side of caution. Now, I'm working out the logic for time slot generation to minimize potential conflicts.

**Defining Final Output Checks**

I'm now creating comprehensive checks to ensure the JSON output's correctness and adherence to every scheduling rule. This includes verifying valid JSON and confirming all assigned time slots, room assignments, and constraint criteria.

```
I've produced a JSON array of schedules, and validated them. The engine has been tested, and is now ready for production.
